Device-model-id is not set on each iot-device in the API method GET: /api/v1/application/{id}/iot-devices
Unfortunately there are no device-model-id in the above mentioned call, so to get the relation between iot-device and device-model, I have to make a call to each iot-device (GET
/api/v1/iot-device/{id}), where I can read the device-model-id.
It would be super if this information was added.
